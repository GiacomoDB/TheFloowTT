<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Display a path over the map as the user moves.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If a journey is defined as a set of recorded locations between a tracking on and a tracking off switch, retain the user&rsquo;s journeys.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Allow the user to see all their journeys in a list.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Allow the user to see the start and end times of their journeys when they select them from the list.</span></li>

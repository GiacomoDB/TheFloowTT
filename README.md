<p><strong>Primary Goals:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Build an app that can display the user&rsquo;s current location on a map</del></li>
<li><del>Update the map in real time as the user moves.</del></li>
<li><del>In response to a &ldquo;tracking on/off&rdquo; UI switch, record or do not record the user&rsquo;s movements.</del></li>
<li><del>Display a path over the map as the user moves.</del></li>
<li><del>If a journey is defined as a set of recorded locations between a tracking on and a tracking off switch, retain the user&rsquo;s journeys.</del></li>
<li><del>Allow the user to see all their journeys in a list.</del></li>
<li><del>Allow the user to see the start and end times of their journeys when they select them from the list.</del></li>
<li><del>The app should record the user&rsquo;s location in the background if the user selects &ldquo;tracking on&rdquo; and backgrounds the app.</del></li>
<li><del>The app should not use the battery if the user selects &ldquo;tracking off&rdquo; and backgrounds the app.</del></li>
<li><del>If the app is resumed from the background during tracking, it should correctly display a path representing the journey that is currently being recorded.</del></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bonus Goals:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><del>Allow the user to see each journey&rsquo;s path plotted on a map, when selected from the list.</del></li>
<li><del>Show any other interesting data you can think of relating to a journey, when selected from the list.</del></li>
<li><del>Secure the data that&rsquo;s stored on the device.</span></li>
</ul>

<li><del>Detect the user&rsquo;s motion, and automatically determine when to turn tracking &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo;, in a way that conserves battery power.</del></li>
</ul>
